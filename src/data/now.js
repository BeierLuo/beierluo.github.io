My research focuses on building **reliable and trustworthy large language models (LLMs)**.
I am broadly interested in understanding, modeling, and improving the **confidence and uncertainty behavior** of modern machine learning systems, particularly in the presence of distribution shifts and open-ended generation.

My current research directions include:

- **Confidence calibration and uncertainty estimation** for large-scale models,
- **Detection and mitigation of hallucinations** in LLMs,
- Theoretical and empirical foundations of **reliable machine learning**.
