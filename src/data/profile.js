> My Chinese name is 贝尔 (Beier), which is pronounced similarly to “Bale”, so my English name became **Bale Luo**.

I am a second-year graduate student from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), under the supervision of [Dr. Hongxin Wei](https://hongxin001.github.io/). I will be joining the Radio Lab at Nanyang Technological University as a PhD student in Fall 2026, under the supervision of [Dr. Xuefeng Du](https://d12306.github.io/). I also received my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from SUSTech.
